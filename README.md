Moreover, the client initially had a very broad scope for the project, which was not feasible to implement within our 14-week timeline.
Task: As part of the team, my task was not only to contribute to the technical development of the project using the MERN stack but also to help manage the project's scope and ensure that we could deliver a functional e-commerce website within the given timeline.
Action: I coordinated with the team members in different time zones and ensured that our work was well-synchronized. I communicated openly and frequently with the client, explaining the limitations and negotiating to narrow down the project's scope to align with our timeline. We also implemented Stripe and PayPal for payment processing to ensure a seamless customer experience.
Result: Despite the challenges, our team successfully delivered the project on time. The client was satisfied with our work, and we received positive feedback from our supervisor. This project was a significant learning experience for me, and the success we achieved as a team was extremely rewarding.
This accomplishment has given me the confidence to handle complex and challenging projects, and it has also taught me the value of clear communication, teamwork, and effective project management.

Task: Our team's task was to ensure that we could continue providing excellent customer service and smoothly manage the station's operations despite being short-staffed.

Action: To cope with the situation and work well as a team, we took the following steps:

1. Reassess and redistribute tasks: We quickly held a team meeting to reassess everyone's roles and responsibilities for the day. Each of us took on additional tasks outside of our usual duties to ensure that all essential operations were covered, such as managing the cashier, assisting customers, and keeping the store stocked and clean.

2. Prioritize tasks: We identified the most critical tasks that needed to be completed immediately and focused our efforts on those areas. By prioritizing and working together, this helped us ensure that the most important aspects of our customer service were not compromised.

3. Maintaining open communication: Throughout the day, our team maintained open communication with each other, updating one another on our progress, and asking for help when necessary. This allowed us to quickly address any issues that arose and provide support to each other.

4. Stay positive and motivate each other: Despite the challenging circumstances, we encouraged one another and maintained a positive attitude, which helped keep our productivity levels high and create a supportive work environment.

Result: By working together efficiently as a team, redistributing responsibilities, prioritizing tasks, and maintaining open communication, we successfully managed to provide excellent customer service and smooth operations at the BP petrol station, despite being short-staffed. Our teamwork and adaptability under pressure proved our ability to handle unexpected challenges while continuing to prioritize our customers' needs.

## Where can you see yourself 5 years from now?

## What was any recent developments in the news about ATO that you came across
A recent development in the news regarding the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is the discontinuation of the temporary "shortcut method" for calculating working from home deductions. This method was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic and allowed individuals to claim a flat rate of 80 cents per hour for all their running expenses related to working from home.

As the pandemic situation has evolved and many businesses and employees are adapting to new working arrangements, the ATO has decided to discontinue the shortcut method. Taxpayers will now have to calculate their working from home expenses using the "fixed rate method" or "actual cost method" when lodging their tax returns.

This change indicates a transition from the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic to more normal conditions. It highlights the ATO's adaptability and responsiveness to changing needs during unprecedented times.

It also underscores the ATO's commitment to maintaining the integrity of the tax system by updating policies and guidelines as the working environment continues to evolve. This news development serves as a reminder for taxpayers to adjust their expectations and calculations for working from home deductions in the upcoming tax year accordingly.

## Tell us about a time you improved a process.
Situation: During my time as a customer service representative at a BP petrol station, I noticed that the process of restocking shelves was taking longer than necessary, affecting our team's efficiency and ability to attend to customers promptly.

Task: My task was to identify the root cause of the inefficiency and find a way to improve the restocking process so that it would be more time-efficient, allowing the team to focus on other tasks and provide better customer service.

Action: I decided to take the following steps to improve the restocking process:

1. Observation: I carefully observed the process over a few days to identify the factors causing delays. I noticed that the main issue was disorganization in the storage room, making it difficult for team members to locate and access items quickly.

2. Reorganization: I proposed to my manager that we reorganize the storage area by implementing a system that grouped items based on categories and popularity, making it easier for team members to find and retrieve products.

3. Training: I provided a brief training session for all team members, explaining the new arrangement and offering tips on how to maintain order in the storage area. This ensured that everyone was aware of the changes and could follow the new system effectively.

4. Monitoring and Feedback: I encouraged the team members to provide feedback and report any potential issues that may arise with the new system. This allowed us to make any necessary adjustments to the organization and address concerns as they occurred.

Result: After implementing the new storage system, our team experienced a significant improvement in the restocking process, reducing the time spent on this task by more than 30%. This allowed us to devote more time to attending to customers and other essential duties, ultimately improving overall customer satisfaction and our team's efficiency. The experience demonstrated the importance of continuous improvement and the value of addressing even small inefficiencies in the workplace.

Context: In my role as a customer service representative at a BP petrol station, I frequently faced challenging situations involving difficult customers. A memorable situation involved a customer who was furious about a pricing error on a promotional item and began causing a scene in the store.

Action: To address the situation, I first remained calm and listened attentively to the customer's concerns, acknowledging their feelings without being defensive. I assured them that I understood their frustration and would do my best to resolve the issue. I checked the promotional details and pricing in our system, confirmed the error, and immediately corrected the price. To further ease the customer's frustration, I offered a sincere apology and a small discount on their purchase as a goodwill gesture.

Result: By maintaining a composed and empathetic demeanor, I was able to deescalate the situation and find a satisfactory resolution for the customer. The customer left the store feeling heard and satisfied with the outcome. This experience reinforced the importance of effective communication and staying calm under pressure when navigating difficult situations in a customer-facing role.

## What is one of your weaknesses?
As a candidate, one of my weaknesses is that I can be overly self-critical at times. While I believe in setting high standards for my performance, I sometimes fixate on small mistakes and imperfections, which can lead to unnecessary stress and hinder my productivity.

To work on this weakness, I have adopted a more balanced approach to self-evaluation. I now make sure to step back and assess my work as a whole, taking note of the positive outcomes and areas where I performed well. When identifying areas for improvement, I consider actionable steps I can take to address these issues and learn from my mistakes, rather than dwelling on them negatively.

This change in mindset has not only helped me become more resilient but has also allowed me to maintain a healthy perspective on my performance, ultimately leading to better results and greater personal and professional growth.

## Tell us about a time you had to explain a complex technical topic to a non-technical person.

As the project lead, it was my responsibility to present the website's features and functionality to the client, including some complex technical aspects related to payment processing using Stripe and PayPal.

Action: To successfully communicate these technical components to the client, I first conducted a brief assessment of their knowledge to gauge their familiarity with basic online payment processes. This helped me tailor my explanation to the appropriate level.

I broke down the complex technical concepts into simpler terms and focused on explaining the benefits and implications of each feature rather than delving into the technical details. I used everyday analogies and visual aids, like diagrams and flowcharts, to support my explanation, making it easier for the client to grasp the concepts. Additionally, I demonstrated how the payment features worked in real-time, walking the client through the process from start to finish. I also encouraged questions and took the time to address any concerns or confusion that arose during the presentation.

Result: By simplifying the complex technical concepts and using relatable analogies, I was able to help the client understand the website's payment features and their importance for a smooth user experience. The client felt more confident about the project, and our team received positive feedback on our ability to communicate effectively with a non-technical audience. This experience reinforced the importance of adapting my communication style to cater to the needs of different stakeholders and making complex topics accessible for everyone involved.

## What are the taxes you know/ What do you know about taxes?
Taxes are financial charges imposed on individuals, businesses, and other entities by governments to fund various public expenditures. They play a crucial role in a country's economy and public services. There are several types of taxes, each serving different purposes and affecting taxpayers differently. Some of the most common taxes include:

1. Income tax: This tax is levied on the income of individuals and businesses and is typically collected through a system of withholding or pay-as-you-earn (PAYE).

2. Corporate tax: This tax applies to the profits earned by a company. The tax rates and structure may vary depending on the jurisdiction and size of the corporation.

3. Sales tax: This is a tax levied on the sale of goods and services by businesses to their customers. The tax is usually added to the product's price and collected by the seller, who later remits it to the government.

4. Value-added tax (VAT): VAT is a consumption tax collected at different stages of the production and distribution process. It is usually charged on the value added to goods and services as they pass through the supply chain.

5. Property tax: This tax is imposed on the ownership or possession of real estate and is typically based on the property's assessed value.

6. Capital gains tax : This tax is applied to the profits made from the sale of assets, such as investments, stocks, bonds, or real estate. The tax rates may vary depending on the holding period of the assets and the taxpayer's income level.

7. Excise tax: This tax is levied on specific goods and services like alcohol, tobacco, and fuel. Excise taxes usually aim to discourage consumption of certain products, protect public health, or recover the social costs associated with their consumption.

8. Payroll tax: This tax comprises both employee and employer contributions towards social security programs such as pension funds, healthcare, unemployment insurance, and other public welfare schemes.

9. Estate and Inheritance tax: These taxes are levied on the transfer of wealth after a person's death. Estate tax is imposed on the total value of the estate, while inheritance tax is charged on the beneficiaries receiving the assets.

10. Customs duties and tariffs: These taxes are applied to goods being imported or exported across national borders. They usually have both revenue-raising and trade protection goals.

Taxes serve as the primary source of revenue for governments, enabling them to finance public services and infrastructure, fund social programs, promote economic growth, reduce income inequality, and maintain the stability of the nation's financial system.

## How have you handled a research task in Uni or work and was there any obstacles and how did your overcame them?
Context: As part as one of my uni projects, I was tasked with conducting market research to better understand a make believe product’s potential competitors and identify their strategies. This research would help our team to present recommendations to improve the product.

Action: I started by identifying the main competitors in the client's niche, reviewing their websites, marketing materials, and customer reviews. I gathered data on their product offerings, pricing strategies, and unique selling propositions. To obtain more comprehensive insights, I utilized various research methodologies, such as analyzing industry reports, studying consumer trends, and following relevant blogs and forums.

During the research process, I faced the obstacle of finding limited qualitative data on users' experiences with the competitors' websites.

Context: During a software development project at university, my team and I were tasked with creating a web-based application for managing events. I was responsible for implementing the user authentication system, which included registration, login, and password recovery processes.

Action: With some prior experience in web development, I felt confident about completing the task independently. I chose to use a particular authentication library, which I had never used before, based on some online recommendations. Without investing enough time in understanding the library's documentation, I proceeded to implement the authentication system.

Result: During the testing phase, our team discovered several bugs and security vulnerabilities in the user authentication process. It became evident that my implementation was lacking in both functionality and security. The team had to allocate additional time and resources to revise and fix the authentication system, impacting our project timeline negatively.

Upon realizing my failure, I took responsibility for the issue and immediately sought guidance from my teammates and professor. I dedicated time to thoroughly study the library's documentation and best practices for user authentication. Additionally, I actively participated in online developer forums and sought feedback from experienced developers to enhance my knowledge.

With a better understanding of the library and secure authentication practices, I successfully re-implemented a more robust and functional user authentication system for the web application. My team managed to complete the project, albeit with some delays.

This experience taught me the importance of conducting thorough research and consulting with peers and mentors before diving into unfamiliar technologies. It also reinforced the value of learning from failures and utilizing them as opportunities for personal and professional growth.
